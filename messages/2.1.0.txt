Version 2.1.0

Improved behavior when opening ZIP archives using Goto Anything:

- Transient previews of ZIP archives no longer steal the Goto Anything panel from the user.
- Contents of ZIP archives opened with Goto Anything are shown after the Goto Anything panel closes.
- Transient previews of very small ZIP archives with no window property no longer cause an error.
